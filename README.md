# React Code Challenge

Someone messed with our code, and now our login screen is completely broken.
It's your task to resolve all outstanding issues so that the app functions as it used to.


## Requirements:
- Functionality and appearance of app should match solution version.
- Do NOT add or delete any files in the repo.
- The app has alredy been styled for you; do NOT modify any CSS/Less files or add custom styles.


### Hints:
- Use the browser's built-in DevTools and/or React DevTools for debugging.
- See TODOs for what/where to fix issues.
- All of your work will happen in the `/src/components/` folder.
- You can changes the names of methods, property, etc. -- but is not advisable.
